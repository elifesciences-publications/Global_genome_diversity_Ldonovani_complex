The ".sh" scripts were run first but are dependent on the file structure of the server they were run. These are:

**a09_allele_freq_phase.sh**

**a09_allele_freq_phase_07line.sh**


They create files that are required as input in the following R script, however, intermediate results files can also be loaded from within the R script:

**a09_allele_freq_phase.r**
